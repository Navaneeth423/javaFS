# ☕ Java Full Stack Learning Repository — `javaFS`

Welcome to my **Java Full Stack Developer Learning Repository** 👋  

This repository contains my **assignments, practice programs, and learning exercises** from my Full Stack Development journey — covering everything from **Core Java** to **Spring Boot, React, and Database integration**.

It’s an evolving space where I write, test, and refine code as I move through different stages of full-stack mastery.
